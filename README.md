# Mini Pomodoro Command Line App

Just a simple command line app to keep focused while working or studying. The idea is based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Must have Python and Tkinter installed.

### Installation and Running

Clone the repository to your machine.

```
git clone <repo name>
```

Cd into the new directory.

```
cd <directory name>
```

Run the program.

```
python3 app.py
```

The program will write a text file formatted in JSON to the current directory.

```
{
    "04/23/19": [
        "You worked on activities for 0.0 hours"
    ]
}
```
